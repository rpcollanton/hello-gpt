Next:

- write generalized routines for training
- support checkpoints
- experiment with saving/loading states
- start small projects -- shakespeare, names, math, arxiv, see here for more datasets: https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets 
- clean up generation interface, write clean examples in ipynb
- write byte pair encoder, other encoders/tokenizers (see karpathy videos, mingpt, and https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/encoder.py)
- write RoPE, sinusoidal?
- write other rotary position embedding (RoPE), and seek other inspiration from deepseek!
- try to load OpenAI parameters? would have to reorganize!
- incorporate changes for speed/parallelization. Use baby GPU :)


tensorflow version:
- organize appropriately as layers/models
- write build methods
- get it to run/evaluate!
- write training loops
